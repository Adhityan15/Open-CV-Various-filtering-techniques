# Computer Vision – Image Filtering Techniques (Python)

This repository contains the implementation of various **image filtering techniques** using **Python and OpenCV** as part of the **6th Semester Computer Vision Laboratory**.

The objective of this experiment is to understand how different spatial filters are used for **image smoothing, noise removal, edge preservation, and edge detection**.

---

## 📌 Filters Implemented

1. Mean (Average) Filtering  
2. Gaussian Filtering  
3. Median Filtering  
4. Bilateral Filtering  
5. Laplacian Filtering (Edge Detection)

Each filter is implemented **individually** as a separate Python program for better understanding and lab record submission.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib
